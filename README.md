## 💡 Why We Built This

Too often, people feel trapped by their diet:  
❌ “I can’t eat this because I’m diabetic.”  
❌ “I want to build muscle but I have high cholesterol.”  
❌ “There’s never food that fits my beliefs *and* my goals.”

CraveWell changes that.  
It doesn’t just tell you *what’s in your food* — it tells you *what your food means for you.*

Because your health shouldn’t stand in the way of your goals or your cravings.  
Let’s redefine nutrition — one plate at a time.
